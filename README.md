## ⚙️ Core Mechanics

- **Mobile & Desktop Ready**  
  Responsive virtual joystick and touch controls for mobile, alongside full keyboard and mouse support on desktop.

- **Turbo Mode**  
  Press **T** (or the mobile button) to activate high-speed automated fire, allowing full focus on movement while your unit maintains continuous fire.
